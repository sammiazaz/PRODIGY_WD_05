## Features

* **Start Functionality:** Begin the stopwatch timer from zero or from a paused state.
* **Pause Functionality:** Temporarily halt the stopwatch timer, preserving the elapsed time.
* **Reset Functionality:** Clear the stopwatch to `00:00:00:00` (Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Milliseconds) and clear all recorded lap times.
* **Lap Functionality:** Record the current elapsed time as a lap without stopping the main timer.
* **Lap Time Display:** A dedicated area to list and display all recorded lap times in sequence.
* **Precise Timing:** Displays time down to milliseconds.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and easy-to-use design for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the elements of the stopwatch application (display, buttons, lap list).
* **CSS3:** For styling the application, making it visually appealing, and potentially adding responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For implementing all the core logic, including starting, pausing, resetting the timer, managing time increments, and handling lap recordings.
